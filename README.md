# StateRepresentation

## TODO Cartpole:

- [x] Implement Prediction of done (end of reward)
- [] Simulate random policy in "dream"
- [] Train in "dream" with Q-learning
- [] Plan (value iteration? or N-step rollout?) using the model
- [] Keep track of observed policy online and retrain model with collected data


## TODO Car Racing:

- [] Implement CNN to shrink state
- [] Encourage state to only contain important values

## Issues

- Doesn't deal with sparse reward
